## Description

This app gives you the ability to create notes from today to the same date next month. You can mark completed tasks and
view them in the calendar. If you only have uncompleted tasks for some date, you can see one dark dot under that date.
If all your tasks are completed on some date, you can see a colored dot under that date. If you have both statuses, you
can see two dots under the date with these tasks. You can also edit and delete your note.
